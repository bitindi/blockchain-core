# Bitindi Chain

## Introduction to Bitindi Chain
Bitindi Chain (BITINDI) is a decentralized, high-efficiency and energy-saving public chain. It is compatible with smart contracts and supports high- performance transactions. The endogenous token of Bitindi is BNI and it adopts the BPoS consensus mechanism.

## Declaration
To help developers’ evolvement at every stage 

## Vision
Technological innovation is the driving force behind the advancement of the blockchain industry, but many innovative projects have been misunderstood and ignored at their early stages. We have witnessed the growth process of great projects. Recalling that Ethereum and Polkadot were questioned as altcoins in the early days, they all went through difficult times. Therefore, Bitindi's mission is not only a public chain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, Bitindi is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## Bitindi’s Performance
- TPS: 2500+
- Average block interval: 3s

## Consensus Mechanism
BPoS consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 21.

## Economic Model 
The endogenous token on the chain is BNI; the transactions consume BNI  as gas fee.

Miners pledge HT to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion. 

## Cross-Chain
Assets such as BTC, ETH and stable coins can be mapped to Bitindi by an asset bridge. The realization method is to lock a certain amount of tokens on the original chain then generate a corresponding number of tokens on Bitindi. 

HBitindi encourages developers to provide more decentralized cross-chain solution.  

## Meta Transaction Function
The meta-transaction function is supported, which allows users to reduce gas fees step-wise, and Bitindi will cover the payment of the reduced part. The meta-transaction function allows to minimize the migration cost of DApp developers, as well as to effectively reduce the cost of DApp users.

## Bitindi Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.

## Current Stage of Bitindi
In December 2022, the Bitindi Chain, Bitindi officially launched its "Tinder" phase, which will focus on improving the on-chain infrastructure, including but not limited to:
Oracles, Voting tools, Anchor Coins, DEX, Lending, Financial Management, Insurance, Synthetic Assets, Cross-Chain Solutions, Data Analysis, Smart Contract Innovation, etc.
In Jan 2023, Bitindi will entered the "Spark" phase, which focuses on improving developer and user experience and infrastructure.

## Support Plan of Bitindi
### Financial Support
- Bitindi will set up a special fund to invest, support and incentivize high-potential developers.
- Bitindi will launch a variety of developer activities and competitions to discover and fund potential developers. 
- In order to reduce the cost of users on Bitindi Dapp, the Bitindi meta transaction function will reduce the gas fee of users holding BNI in a step-wise manner.

### Resource Support
- Projects or developers that have received investment and support from Bitindi have not only the opportunity to get official news report, but also can apply for marketing service packages and promote their projects globally.
